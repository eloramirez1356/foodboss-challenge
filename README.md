Foodboss Challenge

This is the repository for the Take Home Challenge. 

Installation:

Npm install in the root folder of foodboss-challenge for installing the dependencies of the Node.js server

`npm install` in the folder client inside the root folder (/foodboss-challenge/client) for installing the dependencies of the React client
`npm start` in the root folder for running the Node.js server in the port 3001 of localhost
`npm start` in the client folder for running the React client

Test the application in the web browser:

The table shows at the beginning movies without filter.
The buttons over the table let the user set filters, and the buttons below the table lets the user add more information from the database, using pagination of 10 movies.

*INFORMATION*: I have tried to develop the bonus for redux but I did not have time. Nevertheless I will finish it during this week. 
Thanks!
